# ⚖️ Elastic Load Balancing (ELB): High Availability & Traffic Distribution

## 📌 Project Level: Beginner–Intermediate
A practical AWS networking and compute project where you deploy three EC2 instances, configure a Target Group, and set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic for high availability and improved performance.

---

## 📝 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a reliable, multi-instance setup using AWS Elastic Load Balancing.  
You create a security group, launch EC2 instances with user-data, register them to a Target Group, and configure an ALB to distribute incoming traffic across healthy instances.

It focuses on high availability, scalability, and traffic distribution across Availability Zones.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To deploy a highly available AWS architecture using an Application Load Balancer that distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances, ensuring redundancy and continuous uptime.

---

## 🧰 AWS Services Used
- **Amazon EC2** — Launching Linux servers  
- **Security Groups** — Allowing HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH traffic  
- **Target Groups** — Registering EC2 instances  
- **Application Load Balancer** — Distributing traffic and improving availability  

---

## 🧠 What This Project Teaches
- Creating and configuring custom Security Groups  
- Launching multiple EC2 instances with automated setup using user-data  
- Understanding Target Groups and health checks  
- Configuring an Application Load Balancer  
- Observing real-time traffic distribution  
- Managing multi-instance, multi-AZ workloads  
- Cleaning up networking and compute resources responsibly  

---

## 🚀 Project Steps (Simplified)
1️⃣ Create a Security Group allowing HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH.  
2️⃣ Launch three EC2 instances using Amazon Linux and a user-data script.  
3️⃣ Rename and organize instances for clarity.  
4️⃣ Create a Target Group and register all EC2 instances.  
5️⃣ Set up an Application Load Balancer and attach it to the Target Group.  
6️⃣ Test the ALB DNS endpoint to verify load distribution.  
7️⃣ Clean up EC2 instances, ALB, Target Group, and security groups.

Full detailed steps with screenshots are available in the project documentation.
