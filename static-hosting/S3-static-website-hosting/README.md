# 🌐 AWS Static Website Hosting on Amazon S3

## 📌 Project Level: Beginner
A simple and practical AWS project where you host a fully static website on **Amazon S3** without adding a bucket policy.  
The S3 bucket serves HTML pages directly through its static website endpoint while keeping access settings minimal and beginner-friendly.

---

## 📝 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to create an S3 bucket, upload website files, configure static website hosting, and access the site using the S3 website endpoint.

It introduces the basics of hosting on S3 without applying a public-read bucket policy — instead, you rely on the S3 **Static Website Hosting** feature and object-level permissions.

This project is ideal for beginners taking their first step into AWS cloud hosting.
