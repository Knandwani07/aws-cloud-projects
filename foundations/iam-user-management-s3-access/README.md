# 🔐 IAM User Management and S3 Full Access

## 📌 **Project Level:** Beginner  
A foundational AWS security project where you create an **IAM user**, grant **S3 Full Access**, and host an image in an S3 bucket using the permissions assigned to the new user.

---

## 📝 **Project Overview**  
This project demonstrates how to create a secure IAM user, assign the **AmazonS3FullAccess** policy, log in as that user, and upload & host an image inside an S3 bucket.  
It builds essential knowledge of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and hands-on experience with S3 object hosting.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**  
To create an IAM user with S3 full-access permissions, log in with that user’s credentials, create an S3 bucket, upload an image, and make it publicly accessible.

---

## 🧰 **AWS Services Used**
- **AWS IAM** — Create and manage users  
- **Amazon S3** — Create buckets, upload files, and host objects  
- **Bucket Policies** — Enable public access to files  

---

## 🧠 **What This Project Teaches**
- Creating IAM users with console access  
- Assigning IAM policies (AmazonS3FullAccess)  
- Understanding IAM credentials and login flow  
- Creating and configuring S3 buckets  
- Uploading and publicly hosting images using object URLs  
- Cleaning up cloud resources responsibly  

---

## 🚀 **Project Steps (Simplified)**

1️⃣ **Access IAM and create a new user** with console access and a custom password.  
2️⃣ **Assign the AmazonS3FullAccess policy** directly to the user during creation.  
3️⃣ **Retrieve IAM login credentials** and sign in using the provided console URL.  
4️⃣ **Log in as the newly created IAM user** and change the password on first login.  
5️⃣ **Create a new S3 bucket** using the IAM user’s permissions.  
6️⃣ **Upload an image to the bucket** using the S3 upload interface.  
7️⃣ **Attach a bucket policy** to allow public read access to objects.  
8️⃣ **Open the uploaded image using the Object URL** to verify successful hosting.

## 🌟 **Key Features**
- Complete IAM user setup with console access  
- Practical use of IAM policies for permission control  
- Real-world demonstration of S3 Full Access permissions  
- Image hosting via publicly accessible S3 Object URL  
- Clear understanding of AWS identity, access, and object-level permissions  

---

## 🧹 **Cleanup**
- Delete the uploaded objects from the S3 bucket  
- Delete the S3 bucket itself  
- Remove the IAM user if no longer needed  
- Follow IAM & S3 best practices for secure resource cleanup  

---

## 🏁 **Outcome**
By completing this project, you learn how AWS IAM and S3 work together to control access and manage cloud resources securely.  
You also gain real experience uploading and hosting files in S3 using permissions from a custom-created IAM user.
