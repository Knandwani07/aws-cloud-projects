# AWS Foundations

The **Foundations** section contains beginner-level AWS projects focused on core cloud concepts such as compute, identity management, security, storage, access methods, and basic cost control.  
These projects establish the skills required before moving to networking, serverless, analytics, automation, or container-based workloads.

Each project in this folder includes:
- A detailed README  
- A demo video  
- Documentation  
- Clear, practical steps  

This section reflects hands-on understanding of the AWS basics.

## Next Steps

After completing the Foundations section, the recommended progression is:
- **Networking & High Availability**  
- **Static Hosting**  
- **Serverless**  
- **Data Analytics**  
- **Databases**  
- **Event-Driven Architectures**  
- **Containers**

Each section builds on the concepts learned here and gradually increases in complexity.
