# AWS Static Hosting

The Static Hosting section contains beginner–intermediate AWS projects focused on hosting websites, distributing static content, automating deployments, and enabling multi-region availability using Amazon S3 and AWS Amplify.

These projects teach how to host websites without servers, automate updates, and architect globally resilient static workloads.

Each project in this folder includes:

- A detailed README  
- A demo video  
- Documentation  
- Clear, practical steps  

This section reflects hands-on understanding of static hosting, automation, and global content delivery using AWS.

## Purpose of This Section

The Static Hosting projects aim to build:

- Confidence hosting websites using S3 and Amplify  
- Knowledge of object storage, replication, and static delivery  
- Understanding of basic automation using GitHub → S3  
- Awareness of multi-region redundancy using CRR  
- Practical skills for deploying frontend applications on AWS  

This section establishes the fundamentals of serverless static hosting and deployment automation.

## Next Steps

After completing the Static Hosting section, the recommended progression is:

- Serverless  
- Data Analytics  
- Databases  
- Event-Driven Architectures  
- Containers  

Each section builds on the concepts learned here and gradually increases in complexity.
