# AWS Databases

The **Databases** section contains AWS projects focused on managed database services, scalable backend architecture, secure connectivity, and real-world application integration between compute and database layers.

These projects help you understand how AWS handles relational databases, automated backups, networking, and secure connectivity—essential skills before working with large-scale data systems, analytics pipelines, or multi-tier architectures.

Each project in this folder includes:

- A detailed README  
- A demo video  
- Documentation  
- Clear, practical steps  

This section reflects hands-on understanding of **cloud-native database deployment** and backend connectivity.

## Projects Included

### **1. Scalable MariaDB Architecture using RDS + EC2**  
**[Open Project Folder](https://github.com/Knandwani07/aws-cloud-projects/tree/93d7865584fa4fac4f6a4a8373fb2941e0a1ad23/databases/scalable-mariadb-architecture-rds-ec2)**

A production-style database setup using **Amazon RDS (MariaDB)** connected securely to an **EC2 Linux server**.  
This project demonstrates how to deploy a managed database, configure secure networking using security groups, install SQL tools on EC2, and run SQL operations using the RDS endpoint.

## Purpose of This Section

The Databases projects aim to build:

- Strong understanding of **Amazon RDS** and managed relational databases  
- Ability to configure and secure database access  
- Real-world experience connecting compute (EC2) to managed databases  
- Confidence running SQL operations in cloud environments  
- Awareness of multi-AZ architectures, automated backups, and maintenance windows  

This section prepares you for advanced backend architecture, production workloads, and scalable database design.

## Next Steps

After completing the Databases section, the recommended progression is:

- Event-Driven Architectures  
- Data Analytics  
- Serverless  
- Containers  
- High Availability & Networking  

Each section builds on the database fundamentals learned here and gradually increases in complexity, helping you design full cloud-native systems end-to-end.
