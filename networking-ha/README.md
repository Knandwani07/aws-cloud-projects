# AWS Networking & High Availability

The Networking & High Availability section contains intermediate-level AWS projects focused on building resilient, scalable, and secure network architectures.  
This section covers load balancing, auto scaling, fault-tolerant multi-AZ VPC design, health checks, and cloud monitoring.

These projects prepare you for production-grade architectures and build the skills required before moving into serverless, analytics, automation, and containerized workloads.

Each project in this folder includes:

- A detailed README  
- A demo video  
- Documentation  
- Clear, practical steps  

This section demonstrates hands-on understanding of AWS networking, traffic distribution, high availability, and operational monitoring.

### **5. High Availability VPC Architecture**  
[Open Project Folder](https://github.com/Knandwani07/aws-cloud-projects/tree/50195819d78f4440288f9b2d6bf724bd2abbca43/networking-ha/high-availability-vpc-architecture)

Designing a multi-AZ VPC with public and private subnets, Internet and NAT Gateways, and proper route tables for secure and reliable networking.

---

## Purpose of This Section

The Networking & High Availability projects aim to build:

- Understanding of load balancing and traffic routing  
- Knowledge of Auto Scaling and multi-AZ redundancy  
- Skills in building secure, scalable VPC architectures  
- Confidence in monitoring and alerting through CloudWatch  
- Awareness of distributed systems and fault-tolerant design  

These projects establish the networking foundation required for advanced AWS topics.

## Next Steps

After completing the Networking & High Availability section, the recommended progression is:

- Static Hosting  
- Serverless  
- Data Analytics  
- Databases  
- Event-Driven Architectures  
- Containers  

Each section builds on the principles learned here and gradually increases architectural complexity.
