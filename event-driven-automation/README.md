#  AWS Event-Driven Automation

The Event-Driven Automation section contains AWS projects focused on creating automated workflows using serverless events, scheduled triggers, and function-driven execution.  
These projects help you understand how AWS services interact in real time to automate processes without servers, cron jobs, or manual intervention.

Each project in this folder includes:

- A detailed README  
- A demo video  
- Documentation  
- Clear, practical steps  

This section reflects hands-on understanding of event-driven design, automation patterns, and cloud-native orchestration.

## Projects Included

### 1. Event-Driven Automation with Amazon EventBridge  
 **[Open Project Folder](https://github.com/Knandwani07/aws-cloud-projects/tree/5cd4970e20a6a091f52d84c6a30e67044e9ee191/event-driven-automation/event-driven-automation-with-eventbridge)**  

A serverless automation project where Amazon EventBridge triggers a Lambda function based on scheduled events.  
You learn how to build automated workflows using cron/rate expressions, event targets, and CloudWatch Logs to verify Lambda execution.

## Purpose of This Section

The Event-Driven Automation projects aim to build:

- Strong understanding of Amazon EventBridge and scheduled rule creation  
- Confidence with Lambda-based event processing  
- Real-world experience building automated workflows  
- Awareness of event routers, cron expressions, and serverless orchestration  
- Practical skills required for modern DevOps, cloud operations, and backend automation  

This section prepares you for advanced serverless integrations, distributed event-driven systems, and automated cloud operations.

## Next Steps

After completing the Event-Driven Automation section, the recommended progression is:

- Serverless  
- Containers  
- Data Analytics  
- Databases  
- High Availability & Networking  
- Static Hosting  

Each section builds on your automation knowledge and gradually expands your ability to design fully event-driven, cloud-native systems end-to-end.
