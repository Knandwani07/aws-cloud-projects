# 🤖 AWS AI & Machine Learning

The AI & Machine Learning section contains beginner-friendly AWS projects focused on conversational AI, natural language processing, and fully managed ML-driven services.  
These projects introduce how AWS enables intelligent interactions without requiring complex ML model building or training.

Each project in this folder includes:

- A detailed README  
- A demo video  
- Documentation  
- Clear, practical steps  

This section reflects hands-on understanding of AWS conversational AI and managed machine learning capabilities.
