# AWS Serverless

The Serverless section contains intermediate–advanced AWS projects focused on building event-driven applications using Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Step Functions.  
These projects demonstrate how to run scalable workloads **without managing servers**, handling real-time communication, workflow orchestration, and backend automation efficiently.

Each project in this folder includes:

- A detailed README  
- A demo video  
- Documentation  
- Clear, practical steps  

This section reflects hands-on understanding of serverless design patterns, automation, and event-driven cloud architectures.

## Projects Included

### **1. Serverless Order Overflow Workflow (Step Functions + Lambda)**  
[Open Project Folder](https://github.com/Knandwani07/aws-cloud-projects/tree/68b6b871590852222a56f2b7024850a4b4ab4152/serverless/serverless-order-overflow-step-functions)

A multi-stage order processing workflow built using AWS Step Functions and Lambda.  
It validates orders, simulates payments, checks inventory, and updates results in DynamoDB — fully automated using a state machine.

A real-time, bi-directional WebSocket chat app built with API Gateway WebSocket APIs, Lambda, and DynamoDB.  
It manages active connections, broadcasts messages, and shows how event-driven architectures power live applications.

## Purpose of This Section

The Serverless projects aim to build:

- Confidence designing event-driven applications  
- Understanding of API Gateway, Lambda, Step Functions, and DynamoDB  
- Skills in workflow orchestration and real-time communication  
- Awareness of serverless best practices such as stateless logic, automation, and cost efficiency  
- Hands-on experience creating modern backend systems without provisioning servers  

This section prepares you for building production-ready serverless applications and complex workflows.

## Next Steps

After completing the Serverless section, the recommended progression is:

- Data Analytics  
- Databases  
- Event-Driven Architectures  
- DevOps & Containers  

Each section builds on the concepts learned here and gradually increases in complexity.
