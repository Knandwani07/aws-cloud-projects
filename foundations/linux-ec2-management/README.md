# 🖥️ Deploying and Managing a Linux EC2 Instance on AWS

## 📌 **Project Level:** Beginner  
A foundational AWS project that teaches how to launch, connect to, manage, and terminate a **Linux EC2 instance**.  
You learn instance creation, networking basics, Linux command execution, and essential cost management.

---

## 📝 **Project Overview**  
This project covers the complete flow of deploying a **Linux EC2 instance**, setting up basic security, connecting through **EC2 Instance Connect**, executing Linux commands, and properly removing the instance to avoid charges.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**  
To launch, access, and manage a Linux EC2 instance on AWS while understanding compute basics, SSH access, and cloud resource lifecycle.

---

## 🧰 **AWS Services Used**
- **Amazon EC2** – Launch and manage virtual machines  
- **Security Groups** – Configure network access  
- **EC2 Instance Connect** – SSH from the browser  

---

## 🧠 **What This Project Teaches**
- How to launch Linux servers on AWS  
- Basics of EC2 instance types and AMIs  
- Understanding SSH access and security groups  
- Running Linux commands in a cloud-based terminal  
- Importance of terminating cloud resources  

---

## 🚀 **Project Steps (Simplified)**

1️⃣ **Access the EC2 service and open the dashboard** to prepare for instance creation.  
2️⃣ **Launch a new Linux instance** by selecting an AMI, choosing t3.micro, and entering a name.  
3️⃣ **Configure security settings** by using or creating a Security Group that allows SSH (port 22).  
4️⃣ **Launch the instance** and wait for it to reach the “running” and healthy state.  
5️⃣ **Connect to the instance** using EC2 Instance Connect from the AWS Console.  
6️⃣ **Run basic Linux commands** to verify access and test functionality.  
7️⃣ **Terminate the instance** once done to avoid unnecessary AWS charges.
