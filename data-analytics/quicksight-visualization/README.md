# 📊 Data Visualization with Amazon QuickSight  
## 📌 Project Level: Intermediate  

A hands-on AWS analytics project where you create an interactive **data visualization dashboard** using **Amazon QuickSight**.  
This project demonstrates how raw dataset files can be transformed into meaningful insights through visuals, charts, filtering, and dashboards without needing advanced BI tools.

Using a Netflix dataset, you build a complete QuickSight dashboard that highlights content trends, categories, ratings, release patterns, and other key data insights.

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project walks through uploading a dataset into **Amazon QuickSight**, preparing it for analysis, and building an interactive dashboard.  
You clean and format the data, create visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, KPIs), apply filters, add calculated fields, and design a polished analytics report.

The final dashboard gives a clear, visual representation of patterns within the Netflix catalog, helping convert raw data into actionable insights.
