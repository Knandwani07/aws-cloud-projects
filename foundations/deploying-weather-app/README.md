# ⛅ Deploying a Weather App on AWS S3

## 📌 **Project Level:** Beginner  
A simple hands-on project that teaches how to host a **static website** on AWS S3.  
You deploy a fully functional Weather App by configuring an S3 bucket, managing permissions, and enabling public access.  

---

## 📝 **Project Overview**  
This project walks through deploying a **Weather Application** using **Amazon S3 Static Website Hosting**.  
You create an S3 bucket, upload HTML/CSS/JS files, configure public permissions, and access the app via a public S3 URL.  

---

## 🎯 **Objective**  
To host a static Weather App on **AWS S3**, configure permissions, apply a public access bucket policy, and make the application accessible using the generated object URL.  

---

## 🧰 **AWS Services Used**
- **Amazon S3** — bucket creation, hosting static files  
- **S3 Bucket Policy** — enabling public read access 
- **Static Website Hosting** — serving HTML/CSS/JS 

---

## 🧠 **What This Project Teaches**
- Creating and configuring an S3 bucket 
- Disabling “Block Public Access” for hosting 
- Enabling **Versioning**   
- Uploading files: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images 
- Adding a public read bucket policy   
- Accessing the app using the object URL

---

## 🚀 **Project Steps (Simplified)**
1. Open **AWS Console** → Go to **S3** 
2. Create a new bucket with a globally unique name
3. Disable **Block Public Access** for static hosting
4. Turn on **Bucket Versioning** 
5. Upload your Weather App files 
6. Attach a **public read** bucket policy 
7. Open the uploaded `index.html` → copy the object URL
8. Paste in the browser → Weather App live online

---

## 🌟 **Key Features**
- Static Weather App hosted purely on S3 
- Publicly accessible site using object URL
- Versioning enabled for safer deployments 
- Simple, cost-effective deployment without servers

---

## 🧹 **Cleanup**
To avoid unnecessary S3 charges:  
- Empty all objects inside the bucket
- Permanently delete files 
- Delete the S3 bucket 

---

## ✅ **Outcome**
The Weather App is successfully hosted using **Amazon S3**, demonstrating essential skills in static hosting, bucket configuration, and access management.  
This project builds confidence in using AWS S3 for lightweight web deployments.
