# AWS Data Analytics

The Data Analytics section contains AWS projects focused on serverless querying, data cleaning, business intelligence, and real-world log analysis workflows.  
These projects help you understand how AWS processes, transforms, catalogs, and analyzes structured and semi-structured data using fully managed services.

Each project in this folder includes:

- A detailed README  
- A demo video  
- Documentation  
- Clear, practical steps  

This section reflects hands-on understanding of cloud-native analytics, data engineering pipelines, and visualization tools.

## Projects Included

### 1. QuickSight Visualization  
**[Open Project Folder](https://github.com/Knandwani07/aws-cloud-projects/tree/96ff3d964ebf052da6ce3c519ef4e009816ae239/data-analytics/quicksight-visualization)**  

A BI-focused project where you prepare a dataset, upload it into QuickSight, and build a fully interactive analytics dashboard.  
You learn dataset imports, field transformations, chart creation, and dashboard publishing.

---

### 2. Glue DataBrew Cleaning  
**[Open Project Folder](https://github.com/Knandwani07/aws-cloud-projects/tree/96ff3d964ebf052da6ce3c519ef4e009816ae239/data-analytics/glue-databrew-cleaning)**  

A data engineering project that uses AWS Glue DataBrew to clean, transform, and prepare raw datasets stored in S3.  
You apply recipe steps, automate processing with jobs, and output cleaned data for analytics.

---

### 3. Athena Playground  
**[Open Project Folder](https://github.com/Knandwani07/aws-cloud-projects/tree/96ff3d964ebf052da6ce3c519ef4e009816ae239/data-analytics/athena-playground)**  

A serverless analytics project where you enable CloudFront logging, store logs in S3, catalog them with Glue, and run SQL queries using Athena.  
You explore log analysis, traffic patterns, status codes, and more through Athena's SQL engine.

---

### 4. Data Exchange → S3 → Athena  
**[Open Project Folder](https://github.com/Knandwani07/aws-cloud-projects/tree/96ff3d964ebf052da6ce3c519ef4e009816ae239/data-analytics/data-exchange-s3-athena)**  

A workflow-based project where you subscribe to a dataset using AWS Data Exchange, export it to S3, catalog it using Glue Crawlers, and query it using Athena.  
You learn the full lifecycle of acquiring, cataloging, and analyzing third-party datasets.

---

## Purpose of This Section

The Data Analytics projects aim to build:

- Strong understanding of serverless analytics workflows  
- Confidence using tools like Athena, Glue DataBrew, and QuickSight  
- Real-world experience performing SQL queries on S3 data  
- Skills in cleaning, transforming, and cataloging datasets  
- Awareness of BI dashboards, data ingestion, and metadata automation  

This section prepares you for advanced data engineering, business intelligence, and analytics pipelines in cloud environments.

## Next Steps

After completing the Data Analytics section, the recommended progression is:

- Serverless  
- Databases  
- Event-Driven Architectures  
- Containers  
- High Availability & Networking  
- Static Hosting  

Each section builds on your analytics knowledge and gradually expands your ability to design full cloud-native architectures end-to-end.
