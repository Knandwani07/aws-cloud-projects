# DevOps Basics

The DevOps Basics section contains essential hands-on projects focused on developer workflows, version control, secure authentication, and working directly from Linux-based environments.  
These projects introduce the foundational DevOps skills needed before moving to CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, Infrastructure as Code, or automated cloud deployments.

Each project in this folder includes:

- A detailed README  
- A demo video  
- Documentation (where applicable)  
- Clear, practical steps  

This section reflects hands-on understanding of real-world DevOps operations using Git, Linux, and secure workflows.

## Projects Included

### 1. Pushing Code to GitHub from a Linux Server (Secure Workflow)  
**[Open Project Folder](https://github.com/Knandwani07/aws-cloud-projects/tree/cbe32619b20c0e0bd40978549e032b7be16ac0b9/devops-basics/pushing-code-from-linux-server)**

A secure Git and SSH workflow project where you configure authentication on a Linux server and push code to GitHub without exposing passwords or personal access tokens.

This project covers generating SSH keys, connecting GitHub with identity-based authentication, staging and committing files, and safely pushing code from a remote Linux machine—an essential skill for DevOps engineers working on EC2, cloud servers, or production environments.

## Purpose of This Section

The DevOps Basics projects aim to build:

- Strong understanding of Git fundamentals in Linux environments  
- Ability to configure secure SSH authentication for GitHub  
- Experience pushing, pulling, and managing code from remote servers  
- Comfort using Linux command-line tools for development workflows  
- Awareness of secure development and identity-based authentication techniques  
- Confidence working directly on cloud or on-premises Linux systems  

This section prepares you for more advanced DevOps workflows such as:

- Automated CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline)  
- Docker and containerization  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)  
- Configuration management (Ansible, Chef)  
- Kubernetes and orchestration  
- Cloud-native automation

## Next Steps

After completing the DevOps Basics section, the recommended progression is:

- **Containers** — Build & deploy containerized applications  
- **Serverless** — Automate logic using Lambda & Step Functions  
- **Event-Driven Architectures** — Trigger workflows with EventBridge  
- **Data Analytics** — Query & transform data using AWS services  
- **High Availability & Networking** — Design scalable cloud infrastructure  
- **Static Hosting** — Deploy front-end applications at scale  

Each new category builds on the DevOps foundation established here, helping you design secure, automated, and production-ready cloud systems end-to-end.
