# 📊 Enhancing Cloud Cost Management with AWS Billing Alarms

## 📌 **Project Level:** Beginner  
A simple yet powerful project to help understand **AWS cost monitoring**, budgeting, and alerting. Ideal for anyone learning how to manage cloud expenses effectively.

---

## 📝 **Project Overview**  
This project demonstrates how to set up **AWS Billing Alarms** using **AWS Budgets** and **Amazon CloudWatch** to track cloud spending in real-time.  
You create a monthly budget, define threshold alerts, and receive notifications when your AWS costs begin to rise.

This prevents unexpected billing surprises and builds foundational knowledge in **cloud cost governance**.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**  
To configure a **monthly cost budget** and automated **threshold alerts** (50%, 75%, 100%) to monitor AWS spending and receive real-time notifications before overspending.

---

## 🧰 **AWS Services Used**
- **AWS Budgets** → Set spending limits  
- **Amazon CloudWatch** → Billing alarms  
- **AWS SNS (optional)** → Email/SMS notifications

## 🧠 **What This Project Teaches**
- How to navigate AWS Billing Dashboard  
- How to create a **Monthly Cost Budget**  
- How to configure **multiple alert thresholds**  
- How **CloudWatch Billing Alarms** monitor real-time usage  
- How alerts help maintain financial control in the cloud  

---

## 🚀 **Project Steps (Simplified)**
1. Open **Billing & Cost Management** on AWS  
2. Go to **Budgets & Planning**  
3. Create a **Monthly Cost Budget**  
4. Enter your cost limit  
5. Add alerts at **50%, 75%, 100%**  
6. Configure email/SNS notifications  
7. Save and validate the alarm setup

## 🌟 **Key Benefits**
- **Real-time spending visibility**  
- **Alerts before overspending**  
- Helps build discipline in **cloud cost optimization**  
- Ideal for students, beginners, or anyone experimenting with AWS  

---

## 🧹 **Cleanup**
To avoid unnecessary alerts:
- Delete the AWS Budget  
- Remove CloudWatch billing alarms  
- Delete SNS topics/subscriptions (if used)  

---

## ✅ **Outcome**
You gain practical hands-on experience in **AWS cost monitoring**, **budgeting**, and **alert automation**.  
This project builds the foundation for more advanced AWS financial management and ensures better control over cloud usage.
